# Laura_Sprint_1

As a starting point, our group chose to work with Structures of Squares, a plotter drawing by Vera Molnar (1974). In this piece Veran explored randomly distorted squares arranged within a 5×5 grid. During my re-coding process, I began by placing rectangles randomly on the canvas. I then progressed to creating a structured grid using loops, which brought the composition closer to Molnar’s original concept.
Once I had a basic version of the piece functioning, I began to experiment with different parameters. I adjusted the grid size, trying layouts from a sparse 3×3 to a very dense 30×30. I found it fascinating how changes in the scale and number of elements drastically altered the visual impact of the work. This led me to push the experiment further by replacing squares with ellipses. The result introduced a softer, more organic quality, which reminded me of another Molnar piece — Lettres à ma mère (1981-1990) where she distorted text over time until it became nearly unreadable. That conceptual evolution intrigued me, and I decided to integrate a similar process into my own sketches.
I then shifted focus to exploring color and form. Using red, blue, and green with reduced opacity, I aimed to create overlapping effects that added depth and visual complexity. A key moment in the process was realizing how a simple change—like using a fill instead of a stroke—could completely transform the feel of the artwork. I experimented with combinations of both, observing how form and color interacted within the grid structure.
To close off Sprint 1, I introduced interactive movement into the sketches. I used the foundation of a code I had worked on during my Reflect course on generative code and blended it with the existing code for this project. This transformation turned the static composition into something more dynamic and engaging. 
Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of Vera Molnar’s methods and how small iterative changes can lead to unexpected outcomes. It also revealed how generative art is deeply tied to systems thinking—how the logic behind loops, shapes, and randomness can build complexity. Ultimately, what started as a reinterpretation evolved into a personal dialogue with Molnar’s visual language.
