Living Patterns 

What if a machine tried to understand nature?

This question sparked our project during Sprint 3 of the Creative Coding Colabor module. While sitting by the window and becoming aware of the hidden patterns and repeating forms all around us — spirals in flowers, grids in leaves, the branching of trees mirroring lightning or the veins in our bodies — we wondered how a machine might interpret the natural world through a data/code-driven lens.
We began an open, playful exploration using p5.js. We had created various pattern studies, but eventually decided to focus on one theme: coral. Each of us developed code for three distinct types of coral, which we will present in the form of 6 printed A2 posters.
Our process was experimental and intuitive. Some days we collaborated closely, sharing code and building on each other's ideas; other days we pursued our own paths. We didn’t set out with a fixed outcome in mind. Instead, we allowed curiosity to guide us.
Our goal wasn’t to replicate nature exactly, but to explore how its essence might be translated into generative form. What could a coral look like through an algorithm’s eye? What gets lost, and what new beauty might emerge in its place?
It is not about mimicking reality, but about finding poetry in the space between code and chaos, logic and life.
